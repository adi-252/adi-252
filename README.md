# Hi, I’m Aditya Jumani 👋

🎓 CS + Business student at the University of Southern California (graduating Dec 2025).  
💡 I love building products that combine **AI/ML, computer vision, IoT, and cloud** to turn raw data into meaningful insights.  
📍 Currently exploring **end-to-end product development** — from embedded systems to scalable cloud deployments.
